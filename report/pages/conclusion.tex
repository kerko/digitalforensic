\section{Conclusions}

Using encryption without leaving traces is hard. We discovered many possible ways to gather information about encrypted data. We found much more traces of Truecrypt than anticipated at the start of our project. Truecrypt has unique characteristics which make it possible to detect traces of usage, containers and key files on suspects machines. 
Using time stamps we can retrace the steps of suspects in a lot of cases.

The only viable way to evade most of your findings is to use full disk encryption, assuming the key is not available to the investigators. Some traces can be deleted or obscured, but this requires extensive knowledge of the underlying systems.
Since Truecrypt development is discontinued the relevance of our findings may be obsolete in the future. 

There will always be a continuing race between encryption providers and forensic investigators.
