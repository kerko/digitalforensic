\section{Further techniques}
There are several other ways to handle and analyze encrypted data. 
Proper encryption is not easy and it can be time consuming, especially if not the whole system is encrypted but individual files. 
In this section we describe further techniques to retrieve passwords, data and metadata from encrypted files.
\subsection{Social engineering and retrieving passwords}
The easiest way to obtain passwords of encrypted data is to ask the suspect to reveal it.
An offer for a decreased sentence in exchange could improve the suspects will to do so.
This should be considered especially when the data, retrieved through decryption, could be used as digital evidence in other cases.
In case the suspect is innocent, he is likely willing to give away his password to drop the charges against him.

In the United Kingdom, a organization or a person can be forced to reveal their password by law. 
This is because of part III of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA), which is active since the 1\textsuperscript{st} of October 2007.\cite{lowman2010effect}

Depending on the case, it is useful to apply techniques to extract the password from memory or  memory files. 
This is especially useful when the encrypted files are mounted to the system. 
The chance to obtain the password depends on several factors like the systems state.\cite{MaartmannMoe2009S132}

Methods not covered by our experiment also include attacks directed towards the password, like Brute Force attacks, Rainbow Table attacks and Dictionary attacks. 
These methods are using a list of already known passwords (Rainbow Table, Dictionary) or all possible passwords (Brute Force) in an attempt to find the right password or password hash.
To accelerate these methods, it is useful to create a list of potential passwords, custom built to the suspect. 
While generating this list, it is recommended to include names and birth dates of family members and pets besides other information retrieved through social networks and the social environment of the suspect. 
During this reconnaissance, one could also extract all strings from all the confiscated devices and use them as a list. 
This could be useful since the suspect might has saved the password at some point. 

Another technique is dumpster diving.
That means to look for information in the suspects dumpster. 
The holy grail of dumpster diving is, to find the password written on a piece of paper. 
Aside from that, there are already created lists with standard and often used passwords available.
While this could lead to the correct password and therefore to the immediate decryption of the data, these methods often require a big amount of computing power and can take up a very long time period.
Especially the Brute Force method should only be used, after all other ways to retrival have failed.

\subsection{Retrieving the plaintext}
Sometimes the plain data can be obtained through several ways, for example the thumbnails of pictures like we showed during our experiment. 
This also includes intentional or unintentional Backups on internal or external devices and on cloud systems.
This could be especially useful on devices where automatic synchronization with an online cloud exists (Dropbox, Google, Apple,...). 
Other places to look for include temporary folders, the history of certain programs used to open the files and system specific databases like the thumbnail databases under Windows.
