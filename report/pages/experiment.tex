\section{Experiment}
\subsection{Description and Expected outcome}
We are looking at the live image and the collected data from a system involved in a criminal case. Our goal is to find
all three hidden volumes we created during the setup and to create a timeline of the fraud with the metadata collected with
the tool Redline.

\subsection{Setup}
We used a Windows 7 machine, virtualized with the freeware programm VM Virtual Box. After setting up a clean system, we 
surfed around the internet to collect data on the machine. During this period we also downloaded an encrypted
.rar file, called ImportantWorkFiles.rar. Afterwards we created three different Truecrypt-container, in which we extracted
the data from the .rar file. We opend the copied files several times and dismounted all the truecrypt volumes afterwards.
Then we used the tool Redline to collect all the information of the system to analyse them offline on a different
machine.
